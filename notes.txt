preliminary material properties

wood values based on 100 x 100 beam of C35 soft wood (0.01m^2, 400 kg/m^3, tensile strength 21 MPa, compressive strenth 24.76 MPa, E 8.7GPa)
steel based on HEA100 beam (0.002 m^2, 8000 kg/m^3, strength 250 MPa (tensile and compressive), E 200 GPa)
wood road 50 mm thick boards, + 50% of their weight in underconstruction (10 x 10 beams 40 cm apart) @ 400kg/m^3

for numerical stability reasons, stiffness is only 20% of what it should be
limit connections to at least 0.5 m

node weighth 10 kg

road strength???

path planner: connect middle of road beams? connect waypoints directly?
